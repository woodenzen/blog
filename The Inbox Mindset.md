description: Chasing productivity might inadvertently distance us from meaningful goals and values.

Am I focusing on the wrong inbox? Remember to stop and ask this from time to time. The inbox is not just a list of tasks, but a reflection of our values and priorities. Am I working with my values or against them? Am I letting the productivity algorithm mindset distract me from what truly matters?

> Which inbox?
> It’s easier than ever to fall into an inbox mindset. There are things to do, and we do them.
> Inbox zero is the unattainable goal that fills our days.
> But it avoids the real question, which is: which inbox are we emptying?
