In every conversation, I'm on stage. People expect me to deliver.

You want to feel the presence of the person you are talking to. See them as individuals in their own situations, and remember that they may be busy, wrapped up in their dramas, and may not be interested in what you have to say. Watch what you say and how it affects your conversation partners. Spend more time listening and trying to grasp their feelings.

Look behind the curtain and watch the magic happen. If you want more original, heartfelt communication or are stuck in a rut, start fresh by becoming curious about the world of others.
