description: An example of my renewed sketchnoting. Drawing of a simple idea.
---
This is my first modern attempt at sketch-noting. It graphically portrays my idea. It would take a ton of words to explain. I want to build up my tool kit. 

This was posted in a thread talking about Permanent, Source, and Point notes and how they express my ideas, the ideas of others, and whether these can be considered original ideas. I'm thinking this is a red haring.
