description: An example of a periodic sentence.
---

This is an example of a periodic sentence. I'm working to develop this smooth, poetic writing style. It consists of a string of descriptors, followed by a climax. 

> The rains came back at the start of November, and they meant business—easy, hard, straight, slanting, pouring, splashing, drizzling, mizzling, easing off then starting again with a new light tap dance on the roof. The fronts rolled in off the Pacific like waves on the beach, drenching the Coast Range and Willamette Valley and dumping snow on the Cascades if the front was cold enough. Rain soaked into the ground and swelled the streams, filled the roadside ditches, and even the little, peace-loving Long Tom River rose up fast and brown and went over its banks three times, flooding a few houses on the flats and making a lake on the lowest stretch of Stamper Road.

     * Withholding the main clause until the very end—after clauses, metaphors, and stylistic flourishes—a periodic sentence keeps the reader leaning forward, hungry for resolution.
