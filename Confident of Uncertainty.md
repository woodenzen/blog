description: Clear seeing builds confidence in uncertainty.
---
I write in my journal and in my zettelkasten to test my reflections. In doing so, I shape myself into a mature, intellectual craftsman. 

Historically, creatives keep journals or boxes of notes (a zettelkasten). This is a huge confidence builder; one becomes confident in one's uncertainty.
