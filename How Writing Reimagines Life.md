description: Writing creates a gravitational pull on ideas, reshaping how we read, converse, and connect with the world around us.

James reminds me that living more curiously means writing. You'll become a researcher of the world you care about. It will come to life the more you look.

#### A writing bucket.
It has a traction force field that has a gravitational pull on ideas. Once a bucket of writing starts, reading and conversations change. They have new themes coinciding with the writing bucket. They have more meaning.
