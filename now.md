# What I’m Doing Now.

- I've been having second thoughts about selling my shop. My vision is deteriorating and will continue to diminish. I probably should sell it. Where will my interests take me?
- Breathing has become more central to my life. Letting the breath bring me back to the present moment. 
- Started ENGL4730, Western American Literature. Need to start working on my paper for this class.
- Made [[Mustikkapiirakka (Finnish Blueberry Pie)]]
 
#### SKETCHING
- Working on my urban sketching and a loose style of landscape sketching.
- Practicing figure gesture drawing using nude yoga poses.
  
#### TECH & TOOLS
- AI tools are not allowed in my class, and this will be a challenge that I'm up for to see what role artificial intelligence plays in my creative process.
- I'm considering a new iPad Pro for sketching.

#### READING
- Nisargadatta. I Am That: Talks with Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj. Edited by Sudhakar S. Dikshit, translated by Maurice Frydman, 2nd American ed, Acorn Press, 2012.
- Zitkala-Ša, American Indian Stories

#### HEALTH & VISION
- I've been focusing on my step count — 8678 average steps per day this week. 
- I've restarted my lifting and stretching routine, as exercise is the best medicine. 
- My wife has Parkinson's Disease, which is worsening her anxiety and depression. She also has the early stages of dementia. Being a caregiver on this level is emotionally heavy. I hope I can cope with this.

Hat tip to David Sparks for the idea for [this “Now” page](https://www.macsparky.com/now/). I’m not great at social media, but this page provides me with a way to check in with the world and update you, as David recommends, just as I would when catching up with an old friend.
