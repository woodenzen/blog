# What I’m Doing Now.

* The woodshop is for sale. I'm in a life transition. I'm sad, but in a way, looking forward to refocusing my creative energy.
* We're getting nervous about moving to Moscow. It is coming soon, but we haven't prepared.
* Being less reactive to my impressions is still a work in progress.
  
#### FAMILY AND FRIENDS TIME 
- It's going to be hard to leave this place after 35 years. But I'm ready for the next chapter.
 
#### SKETCHING
- Working on my urban sketching and a loose style of landscape sketching.
- Practicing figure gesture drawing using nude yoga poses.
  
#### TECH & TOOLS
- I've been using various AI tools to explore philosophical questions, and I'm enjoying it.
- I'm considering a new iPad Pro for sketching.
- The new logickeyboard is working out super. I can see the keys and it still responds to my touch typing.

#### READING
- Duhigg, Charles. Supercommunicators: How to Unlock the Secret Language of Connection. First large print edition, Random House Large Print, 2024.
- Maclean, Norman. A River Runs through It. Edited by Barry Moser,  Univ. of Chicago Press, 1993.
- Walter, Jess. So Far Gone. First edition, Harper, 2025.

#### HEALTH & VISION
- My vision will not improve, but in the last week my eye comfort suddenly got way better. Today it has relapsed. Why, I don't know?
- I've been focusing on my step count—6,919 average steps per day this week. 
- I've restarted my lifting and stretching routine, as exercise is the best medicine.

Hat tip to David Sparks for the idea for [this “Now” page](https://www.macsparky.com/now/). I’m not great at social media, but this page provides me with a way to check in with the world and update you, as David recommends, just as I would when catching up with an old friend.
