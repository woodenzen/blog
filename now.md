# What I’m Doing Now.

* I'm writing a feature article for the Inland 360, the local arts and entertainment weekly, on the Rendezvous in the Park, and just doing the second edit.
* We're getting excited about moving to Moscow. We are going to wait for a twin home in the retirement center.
* I'm studying how to be less reactive to my impressions.
  

#### FAMILY AND FRIENDS TIME 
- It's going to be hard to leave this place after 35 years. But I'm ready for the next chapter.
- I miss philosophizing with Rich, who is on vacation. I sure hope he is happy.
 
#### IN THE WOODSHOP
- July will be dedicated to working in the shop, preparing for the Dahman Barn Show, which starts on August 2nd.
- It is challenging to transition from in-depth sketching to woodworking. All my "free" time is drawn to drawing.
- Working with Stephenie on a wall shelf for the Dahman Barn Show.

#### TECH & TOOLS
- I've been using various AI tools to explore philosophical questions, and I'm enjoying it.
- I'm considering a new iPad Pro for sketching.
- With my eyesight, I'm exploring getting a new keyboard. 
- I've been setting up my tech devices for accessibility.
- Actively using voice dictation.
- Bear software is a significant failure in the accessibility department.  

#### READING
- Duhigg, Charles. Supercommunicators: How to Unlock the Secret Language of Connection. First large print edition, Random House Large Print, 2024.
- Robertson, Donald. How to Think Like a Roman Emperor: The Stoic Philosophy of Marcus Aurelius. First edition, St. Martin’s Press, 2019.

#### HEALTH & VISION
- My vision continues to surprise me. What I can and what I can not see is a mystery to me.
- I've been focusing on my step count. 8,505 average steps per day this week. 
- I've restarted my stretching routine, as exercise is the best medicine.

Hat tip to David Sparks for the idea for [this “Now” page](https://www.macsparky.com/now/). I’m not great at social media, but this page provides me with a way to check in with the world and update you, as David recommends, just as I would when catching up with an old friend.
