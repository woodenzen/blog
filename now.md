# What I’m Doing Now.

* The woodshop is SOLD! I'm in a life transition. I'm sad, but I'm looking forward to refocusing my creative energy. Been having second thoughts about the sale. Where will my interests take me?
- Breathing has become more central to my life. Letting the breath bring me back to the present moment. I got distracted by reading the book "Breath" by James Nestor, which was technical and not focused on the meditative aspects of breathing.
- Started ENGL4730, Western American Literature.
- Made [[Mustikkapiirakka (Finnish Blueberry Pie)]]
 
#### SKETCHING
- Working on my urban sketching and a loose style of landscape sketching.
- Practicing figure gesture drawing using nude yoga poses.
  
#### TECH & TOOLS
- AI tools are not allowed in my class, and this will be a challenge that I'm up for to see what role artificial intelligence plays in my creative process.
- I'm considering a new iPad Pro for sketching.

#### READING
- Nisargadatta. I Am That: Talks with Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj. Edited by Sudhakar S. Dikshit, translated by Maurice Frydman, 2nd American ed, Acorn Press, 2012.

#### HEALTH & VISION
- I've been focusing on my step count — 8,968 average steps per day this week. 
- I've restarted my lifting and stretching routine, as exercise is the best medicine.

Hat tip to David Sparks for the idea for [this “Now” page](https://www.macsparky.com/now/). I’m not great at social media, but this page provides me with a way to check in with the world and update you, as David recommends, just as I would when catching up with an old friend.
