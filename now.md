# What I’m Doing Now.

- We've moved! We are now living in a retirement community in Moscow, ID. It has been a whirlwind of adjusting. The shop is disassembled, and the goal is to set up the 2-car garage as a shop. We'll see.
- I'm in the middle of the term, taking ENGL4730, Western American Literature. Need to start working on my final paper for this class.
 
#### SKETCHING
- Not much sketching because of the move, which is about to change.
- Practicing figure gesture drawing using nude yoga poses.
  
#### TECH & TOOLS
- Work through issues with my journaling software, Bear. Syncing with iCloud has been whonky.
- I'm considering a new iPad Pro for sketching.

#### READING
- Nisargadatta. I Am That: Talks with Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj. Edited by Sudhakar S. Dikshit, translated by Maurice Frydman, 2nd American edition, Acorn Press, 2012.
- McDowell, Gary L., and F. Daniel Rzicznek, editors. The Rose

#### HEALTH & VISION
- I've been focusing on my step count — 7807 average steps per day this week, which is about a 1000 fewer than usual.
- I've restarted my lifting and stretching routine, as exercise is the best medicine. 
- My wife has Parkinson's Disease, which is worsening her anxiety and depression. She also has the early stages of dementia. Being a caregiver on this level is emotionally heavy. I hope I can cope with this.

Hat tip to David Sparks for the idea for [this “Now” page](https://www.macsparky.com/now/). I’m not great at social media, but this page provides me with a way to check in with the world and update you, as David recommends, just as I would when catching up with an old friend.
