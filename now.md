# What I’m Doing Now.

- The term is winding down, taking ENGL4730, Western American Literature. I've been struck with an idea for my final writing project that is so exciting I can hardly contain myself. It brings together my interest in Blind and Vision Impairment in young adult literature with this assignment. It had me thinking about a book in which this assignment would be a chapter.
- Finished estate planning.
- Settling into our new home. We've moved to town and are developing new routines.
 
#### SKETCHING
- Not much sketching because of the move and class. 
- Practicing figure gesture drawing using nude yoga poses.
  
#### TECH TOOLS
- I've switched back to Bear journaling. I missed out on too much of the convenience that Bear offers.

#### READING
- Duke, Annie. Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When You Don’t Have All the Facts. Portfolio/Penguin, 2018. Library of Congress ISBN 978-0-7352-1635-8.

#### HEALTH & VISION
- I've been focusing on my step count — 8,537 average steps per day this week, which is usual. This is something I want to focus on and keep up. This will mean I will be walking without Zivon and Mary, taking the bus downtown and walking back. 
- Why can't I seem to establish a lifting and stretching routine, as exercise is the best medicine? 
- I am becoming a caregiver to my wife, who has Parkinson's.

#### Woodworking
- I've been demonstrating spoon carving by hand at the local art gallery. Part of the requirement for them to display my woodwork in the gallery store. 
- The move and associated STUFF have occupied my time and energy, but now that some of that is resolved, cognitive space is opening for the challenges of converting our garage into a shop space. It will be quite a challenge.

Hat tip to David Sparks for the idea for [this “Now” page](https://www.macsparky.com/now/). I’m not great at social media, but this page provides me with a way to check in with the world and update you, as David recommends, just as I would when catching up with an old friend.
