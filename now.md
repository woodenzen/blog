# What I’m Doing Now.

* I’m learning how to be more mindful.
* I am focused on continuing to write regularly.
* I'm embracing journaling.  

#### FAMILY AND FRIENDS TIME
- I'm taking Mary to her first-ever massage by a professional. I'm hoping she loves it. 
- Saturday will be my social day. Moscow Farmers Market, coffee with Rich.

#### PROJECTS

#### IN THE WOODSHOP
I'm doing some finishing work. I'm applying a mission-style finish to a white oak mirror frame. I'm also assembling refrigerator frames, gluing in the magnets, and using a poly finish. I'm doing some spoonwork. What I need to work on is the mission-style coffee table.

Hat tip to Derek Sivers for the idea of [this “Now” page](￼). I’m not great at social media, but this page provides me with a way to check in with the world and update you, as Derek recommends, just as I would when catching up with an old friend.
