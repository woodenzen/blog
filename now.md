# What I’m Doing Now.

* I'm writing two feature articles for the Inland 360, the local arts and entertainment weekly. - One down and one to go.
* I'm trying to adapt to the life of a caregiver.
* I'm studying the life and philosophy of Socrates.
  

#### FAMILY AND FRIENDS TIME 
- We're considering a walkable condo in town as part of our relocation plans.
- It's going to be hard to leave this place after 35 years. But I'm ready for the next chapter.
 
#### IN THE WOODSHOP
- I'm putting the finishing touches on my latest box. Before I finish the box, I have to glue in the bottom liner.
- Next month will be dedicated to working in the shop, preparing for the Dahman Barn Show, which starts on August 2nd.
#### Sketching
- This month has been about sketching. 
- I need to find an easy way to embed sketches here.

#### TECH & TOOLS
- I've been using various AI tools to brainstorm interview questions and as a Socratic conversation partner. The jury is still out on whether this is beneficial. It's an ongoing experiment that's helping me gain insights into my behavior, and I'm enjoying it.

#### READING
- Duhigg, Charles. Supercommunicators: How to Unlock the Secret Language of Connection. First large print edition, Random House Large Print, 2024.
- Robertson, Donald. How to Think Like a Roman Emperor: The Stoic Philosophy of Marcus Aurelius. First edition, St. Martin’s Press, 2019.

#### HEALTH & VISION
- My vision continues to surprise me. What I can and what I can not see is a mystery to me.
- I've been focusing on my step count. 7,739 average steps per day this week. 
- I've restarted my stretching routine, as exercise is the best medicine.

Hat tip to David Sparks for the idea for [this “Now” page](https://www.macsparky.com/now/). I’m not great at social media, but this page provides me with a way to check in with the world and update you, as David recommends, just as I would when catching up with an old friend.
