## My Now Page
Last Updated: 2026.01.25
# What I’m Doing Now. 
- I'm working on getting a shop set up in our 2-car garage. It will be a nice space. Easy to heat, easy to access, and it will be convenient. Wood storage and tool layout are the first things on the list. I've put in a work order for 220V power, which is required for the bandsaw, and we'll see how that goes.
 
#### SKETCHING
  - Each week, I get reminded by filling out this Now page that I need to restart my sketching.

#### READING
- Duke, Annie. Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When You Don’t Have All the Facts. Portfolio/Penguin, 2018. Library of Congress ISBN 978-0-7352-1635-8.
- Schweizer, Harold. On Waiting. Thinking in Action. London: Routledge, 2008.
- Hesse, Hermann, and Ludwig Maximilian Fischer. The Seasons of the Soul: The Poetic Guidance and Spiritual Wisdom of Hermann Hesse. North Atlantic Books, 2011.

#### HEALTH & VISION
- I've been focusing on my step count — 13,036 average steps per day this week, which is way up from last week. This is something I want to focus on and keep up. This will mean I will be walking without Zivon and Mary, taking the bus downtown and walking back. 
- I am becoming a caregiver to my wife, who has Parkinson's and the beginning of dementia. This is challenging my abilities to be the person I want to be.

#### WOODWORKING
- The garage has been cleared out of all the non-woodworking stuff, and the initial layout of the shop tools and storage is done. Now I'm looking forward to the electrician installing the 220V power.

Hat tip to David Sparks for the idea for [this “Now” page](https://www.macsparky.com/now/). I’m not great at social media, but this page lets me check in with the world and update you, as David recommends, just as I would when catching up with an old friend.
