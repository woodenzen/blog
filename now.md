## My Now Page
Last Updated: 2025.06.15
# What I’m Doing Now.

* I'm writing two feature articles for the Inland 360, the local arts and entertainment weekly.
* I'm beginning to question my role in the problems I've experienced.
* I'm studying the life and philosophy of Socrates.
  

#### FAMILY AND FRIENDS TIME 
- We're considering a walkable condo in town with the idea of relocating.
 
#### IN THE WOODSHOP
- I'm continuing to put the finishing touches on my latest box. I've attached the lift and am finishing the final sanding before applying the finish.
- I have 6 rakusu ring orders I'm working on. I had to order some Japanese cedar (hinoki) for a pair of Rinzai rakusu rings.

#### TECH & TOOLS
- The two-window workflow I've set up for journaling is working super.
- I've been using various AI tools. The jury is still out on whether they're all beneficial. It's an ongoing experiment, and I'm enjoying it.

#### READING
- Duhigg, Charles. Supercommunicators: How to Unlock the Secret Language of Connection. First large print edition, Random House Large Print, 2024.
- Robertson, Donald. How to Think Like Socrates: Ancient Philosophy as a Way of Life in the Modern World. First edition, St. Martin’s Press, 2024.

#### HEALTH & VISION
- My vision continues to surprise me. What I can and what I can not see is a mystery to me.
- I've been focusing on my step count. My step count is too low.
- I've restarted my stretching routine, as exercise is the best medicine.

Hat tip to David Sparks for the idea for [this “Now” page](https://www.macsparky.com/now/). I’m not great at social media, but this page provides me with a way to check in with the world and update you, as David recommends, just as I would when catching up with an old friend.
