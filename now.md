# What I’m Doing Now?

* I’m learning how to make better investments in general.
* I am focused on getting back to writing regularly.
* These days, I’m still trying to stick to my habits that I planned at the beginning of the year. 

#### FAMILY AND FRIENDS TIME
I spend time with my wife, whom I love and who is empathetic, beautiful, intelligent, sensual, and loving—a fantastic human being.
I also spend time with my friends, better called my selected family, as they are fantastic people.

#### PROJECTS

#### IN THE WOODSHOP

#### TECH & TOOLS

#### READING

#### HEALTH & VISION

Hat tip to Derek Sivers for the idea of [this “Now” page](￼). I’m not great at social media, but this page provides me with a way to check in with the world and update you, as Derek recommends, just as I would when catching up with an old friend.
