# What I’m Doing Now.

* I'm beginning to question my role in the problems I've experienced.
* I'm studying the life and philosophy of Socrates.
* I am committed to maintaining a regular writing schedule.
  

#### FAMILY AND FRIENDS TIME 
- We continue to consider moving into town.
 
#### IN THE WOODSHOP
- I'm continuing to put the finishing touches on my latest box. I'm hand-shaping the finial in the shape of a cloud. The Mission Frame is in the glass shop to get its mirror installed. What I need to work on is the mission-style coffee table.
- I've been working on some spoon details that are turning out phenomenal.
- I've connected with a new rakusu seamstress and am preparing a few rakusu rings for her.

#### TECH & TOOLS
- I'm adapting a two-window workflow to my journaling. 
- I've been using various AI tools. The jury is still out on whether they're all beneficial. It's an ongoing experiment, and I'm enjoying it.

#### READING
- Duhigg, Charles. Supercommunicators: How to Unlock the Secret Language of Connection. First large print edition, Random House Large Print, 2024.
- Robertson, Donald. How to Think Like Socrates: Ancient Philosophy as a Way of Life in the Modern World. First edition, St. Martin’s Press, 2024.

#### HEALTH & VISION
- My vision continues to deteriorate. 
- I've been focusing on my step count, which varies significantly. In the last week, I averaged 8,439.
- This step count may be too low.
- I want to restart my stretching routine, as exercise is the best medicine. 
- Inflammation in my lower back has subsided, but not completely.

Hat tip to David Sparks for the idea for [this “Now” page](https://www.macsparky.com/now/). I’m not great at social media, but this page provides me with a way to check in with the world and update you, as David recommends, just as I would when catching up with an old friend.
