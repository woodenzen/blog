# What I’m Doing Now.

* The woodshop is for sale. I'm in a life transition. I'm sad, but in a way, I'm looking forward to refocusing my creative energy.
* Non-dual awareness is on the radar. Weird to say it that way. 
* Being less reactive to my impressions is still a work in progress.
  
#### FAMILY AND FRIENDS TIME 
- We had to evacuate because of a wildfire, and the support and care of our neighbors and friends gladdens me.
- We learned that we need to pack a bugout bag and have a plan for an emergency evacuation. Fortunately, our evacuation was short. 
 
#### SKETCHING
- Working on my urban sketching and a loose style of landscape sketching.
- Practicing figure gesture drawing using nude yoga poses.
  
#### TECH & TOOLS
- I've been using various AI tools to explore philosophical questions, and I'm enjoying it.
- I'm considering a new iPad Pro for sketching.
- Got new phone service and a new phone. It's a significant improvement.

#### READING
- Nisargadatta. I Am That: Talks with Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj. Edited by Sudhakar S. Dikshit, Translated by Maurice Frydman, 2nd American ed, Acorn Press, 2012.

#### HEALTH & VISION
- I've been focusing on my step count — 8,868 average steps per day this week. 
- I've restarted my lifting and stretching routine, as exercise is the best medicine.

Hat tip to David Sparks for the idea for [this “Now” page](https://www.macsparky.com/now/). I’m not great at social media, but this page provides me with a way to check in with the world and update you, as David recommends, just as I would when catching up with an old friend.
