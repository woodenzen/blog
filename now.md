# What I’m Doing Now.

* I’m learning how to be more mindful.
* I am focused on continuing to write regularly.
* I'm embracing journaling.
* I'm practicing sketching.  

#### FAMILY AND FRIENDS TIME
- We went to a Nutritionist and she is encouraging Mary to add weight.
- I had a spring-like time at the Farmers Market, conversing with friends I hadn't seen all winter.
- We continue to look at moving into town.
 
#### IN THE WOODSHOP
- I'm putting the finishing touches on my latest box. I'm hand-shaping the finial in the shape of a cloud. The Mission Frame is in the glass shop to get its mirror installed. What I need to work on is the mission-style coffee table.
- I've been working on some spoon details that are turning out phenomenal.   

#### TECH & TOOLS
- I'm looking at a new printer.

#### READING
- Duhigg, Charles. Supercommunicators: How to Unlock the Secret Language of Connection. First large print edition, Random House Large Print, 2024.
- Klein, Ezra and Derek Thompson. Abundance. 1st ed, Avid Reader Press, 2025.
- Phillips, Adam, and Barbara Taylor. On Kindness. 1. American ed, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2009.

#### HEALTH & VISION
My vision continues to deteriorate. 
I've been concentrating on my step count, which varies quite a bit. In the last week, I averaged 10,449.

Hat tip to Derek Sivers for the idea of [this “Now” page](￼). I’m not great at social media, but this page provides me with a way to check in with the world and update you, as Derek recommends, just as I would when catching up with an old friend.
