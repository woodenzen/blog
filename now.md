# What I’m Doing Now.

* I’m learning how to be more mindful.
* I'm studying the life and philosopy of Socrates.
* I am focused on continuing to write regularly.
* I'm embracing journaling.
* I'm practicing sketching.  

#### FAMILY AND FRIENDS TIME
- I'm encouraging Mary to eat with the goal of adding weight.
- I've connected with some old friends. 
- We continue to look at moving into town.
 
#### IN THE WOODSHOP
- I'm continuing to put the finishing touches on my latest box. I'm hand-shaping the finial in the shape of a cloud. The Mission Frame is in the glass shop to get its mirror installed. What I need to work on is the mission-style coffee table.
- I've been working on some spoon details that are turning out phenomenal.
- Rakusu ring orders have come in and I ordered some Mesquite.  

#### TECH & TOOLS
- Worked on the accessability setting on iOS.
- I'm looking at a new printer.

#### READING
- Duhigg, Charles. Supercommunicators: How to Unlock the Secret Language of Connection. First large print edition, Random House Large Print, 2024.
- Robertson, Donald. How to Think Like Socrates: Ancient Philosophy as a Way of Life in the Modern World. First edition, St. Martin’s Press, 2024.

#### HEALTH & VISION
- My vision continues to deteriorate. 
- I've been concentrating on my step count, which varies quite a bit. In the last week, I averaged 8,439.
- Infamation in my low back caused pain and discomfort and I did a steroid bump. It has helped.

Hat tip to Derek Sivers for the idea of [this “Now” page](￼). I’m not great at social media, but this page provides me with a way to check in with the world and update you, as Derek recommends, just as I would when catching up with an old friend.
