# What I’m Doing Now.

- The term is winding down, taking ENGL4730, Western American Literature. My final project is a push, a StoryMap relating William Stafford’s Methow River Poems to the Western American spirit.
 
#### SKETCHING
- Not much sketching because of the move and class. 
- I have to finish my most recent dog portrait of Fred for Scott and Susan.
- Practicing figure gesture drawing using nude yoga poses.
  
#### TECH & TOOLS
- I've switched to IA Writer for my journaling. It's more streamline and there are a few things I miss about Bear, but we'll see how this plays out.
- I'm experimenting with HomeKit. I've started small, controlling the porch lights. It is not working correctly, so there is work to do.

#### READING
- Nisargadatta. I Am That: Talks with Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj. Edited by Sudhakar S. Dikshit, Translated by Maurice Frydman, 2nd American ed, Acorn Press, 2012.
- McDowell, Gary L., and F. Daniel Rzicznek, editors. The Rose Metal Press Field Guide to Prose Poetry: Contemporary Poets in Discussion and Practice. Rose Metal Press, 2010.
-Wilkins, Joe. Fall Back down When I Die. Little, Brown and Company, 2019.

#### HEALTH & VISION
- I've been focusing on my step count — 10,400 average steps per day this week, which is more than usual. I had a couple of big days, which boosted the average. This is something I want to focus on and keep up. This will mean I will be walking without Zivon and Mary, taking the bus downtown and walking back. 
- I've restarted my lifting and stretching routine, as exercise is the best medicine. 
- I am becoming a caregiver to my wife, who has Parkinson's.

Hat tip to David Sparks for the idea for [this “Now” page](https://www.macsparky.com/now/). I’m not great at social media, but this page provides me with a way to check in with the world and update you, as David recommends, just as I would when catching up with an old friend.
