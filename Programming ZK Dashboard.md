description: Lots of progress.

I spent some time today refining my ZK dashboard because I have changed a bit of the YAML for my notes in order to accommodate my blogging software, 11ty. I advanced my blogging with OpenAI's ChatGPT's help. 

I hope that keeping my blogging progress in sight will motivate me to blog more—that, along with my 31by31 blogging challenge.

Today's sketch.
