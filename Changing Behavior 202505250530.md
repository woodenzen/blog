This resonated with me. I think the key is to find an experience that makes the long-term consequences of our actions feel tangible and immediate.

> That’s the thing about learning – it usually happens when seeing the long-term consequences of our actions shocks or surprises enough to change our behavior.

> So, if we’re having difficulty changing our behavior, it might be worth asking – what is an experience that would help us see or experience the long-term consequences of our current path?
