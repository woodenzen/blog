## My Now Page
Last Updated: 2026.01.11
# What I’m Doing Now.
- This is the first time in a long time that I haven't been able to take a University of Idaho class.
 - I've been using the Palouse Woodworkers Collective to stay connected with the local woodworking community. It is a crowded space, but I have to work with what I have until I can set up my own shop.
 - I've started the preperation for changing the garage into a workshop.
 
#### SKETCHING
  - Each week, I get reminded by filling out this Now page that I need to restart my sketching.

#### READING
- Duke, Annie. Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When You Don’t Have All the Facts. Portfolio/Penguin, 2018. Library of Congress ISBN 978-0-7352-1635-8.

#### HEALTH & VISION
- I've been focusing on my step count — 9,971 average steps per day this week, which is way up from last week. This is something I want to focus on and keep up. This will mean I will be walking without Zivon and Mary, taking the bus downtown and walking back. 
- Why can't I seem to establish a lifting and stretching routine? I haveto remember that exercise is the best medicine.
- I am becoming a caregiver to my wife, who has Parkinson's and the begins of dementia.

#### Woodworking
- Challenges with time have conspired against me. Having to find a place for all the "stuff" in the garage has been a challenge. This week, I should find out where I can put the stuff to start the process of organizing the garage for its conversion to a workshop.

Hat tip to David Sparks for the idea for [this “Now” page](https://www.macsparky.com/now/). I’m not great at social media, but this page provides me with a way to check in with the world and update you, as David recommends, just as I would when catching up with an old friend.
