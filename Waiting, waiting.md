The duration of time spent disassociated from time and our surroundings. What is happening? What are the feelings she has? Does she have them in the present moment, or are they like memories of dreams, unexpectedly put together, mixed with real events and fragments of mind? By its nature, waiting is a state separate from the flow of the day. We become objects in the surroundings. Amid all the objects, we sense that we are separate from the many that compose a scene. The scene becomes a farce of reality as we drift in a timeless zone unattached to the clock. Each object takes its own stance.
