description: Writing is both a source of personal fulfillment and a shared gift that bridges human experiences and well-being.

Reading and writing are not the end goals. Connection and expression are. I want to connect and exchange ideas and express my ideas as a reciprocal gift. 

Keep these reasons for reading and writing in mind, and do not let the social pressures of writing interfere. I'm writing for myself. 
 
> The more compelling and interesting reason that most writers seek out readers is, I think, less utilitarian: we receive our writing as a gift, and so it must be given in turn. We write because something needs to be expressed through us, and only by giving the writing to a reader is that need fulfilled. [Mandy Brown](https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/peasant-woodland)

> I yearn for readers both because I need people to receive the gift and because I know my own well-being is entangled up with theirs. [Mandy Brown](https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/peasant-woodland)
