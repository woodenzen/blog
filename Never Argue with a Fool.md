description: Choose composure over confrontation, recognizing that engaging in unproductive arguments undermines self-control and perpetuates chaos. 
---
This shows me that I act foolishly when I argue. I lose my composure and slip into dysregulated behavior. These are instructional clichés. 

	•	“Never argue with an idiot. They will drag you down to their level and beat you with experience.” ― Mark Twain.
	•	Arguing with a fool means that now, there are 2 of them.
	•	"I learned years ago, never to wrestle with a pig, you get dirty, besides the pig likes it." - George Bernard Shaw,
	•	It takes a wise person to know when to keep their mouth shut and let the fool do the talking.
