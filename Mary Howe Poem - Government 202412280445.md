> Government  
> by Mary Howe  
>  –––
>  
> Standing next to my old friend I sense that his soldiers have retreated.  
> And mine? They’re resting their guns on their shoulders  
> talking quietly. I’m hungry, one says.  
> Cheeseburger, says another,  
> and they all decide to go and find some dinner.  
> But the next day, negotiating the too narrow aisles of  
> The Health and Harmony Food Store—when I say, Excuse me,  
> to the woman with her cart of organic chicken and green grapes  
> she pulls the cart not quite far back enough for me to pass,  
> and a small mob in me begins picking up the fruit to throw.  
> So many kingdoms,  
> and in each kingdom, so many people; the disinherited son,  
> the corrupt counselor, the courtesan, the fool.  
> And so many gods—arguing among themselves,  
> over toast, through the lunch salad  
> and on into the long hours of the mild spring afternoon—I’m the god.  
> No, I’m the god. No, I’m the god.  
> I can hardly hear myself talking over their muttering.  
> How can I discipline my army? They’re exhausted and want more money.  
> How can I disarm when my enemy seems so intent?  

This reminded me of Peter O'Tool's character in *The Ruling Class* when he says: "When did I realize I was God? Well, I was praying, and I suddenly realized I was talking to myself."
