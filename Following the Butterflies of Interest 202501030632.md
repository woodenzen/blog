Sacha has me thinking about the difference between feeding many interests and leading a focused life. Different days are flavored with different activities. The way to work with this is to plan and work intentionally. Don't let attention wander unsupervised.    

> Following the butterflies of your interest
> Something about how to follow the butterflies of your interest, because I rarely see this perspective in productivity books and because it's something other people might find helpful.
> - What is the change I want to make in myself? I want to get better at going with the grain of my energy, doing what I want to do (and doing the work that helps me want what is good to want).
> - Who would find this useful? People with many interests - scanners, multi-potentialites, Renaissance-people-to-be.
> - To do this, it would be good to read about:
>   1. Career and life planning, especially unconventional paths
>   2. Productivity
>   3. Writing, note-taking
>   4. Psychology, cognitive limits, distraction
