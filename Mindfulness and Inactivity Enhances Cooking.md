The hidden wealth of inactivity is often overlooked, but it’s crucial for creativity and mindfulness. Inactivity, often seen as mere idleness, is actually the fertile ground from which creative ideas sprout, offering a necessary pause for reflection and innovation. Inactivity is also a synonym for mindfulness. Both are empty of self and available in the midst of activity.

What does the mindful presence of inactivity look like in cooking? In preparing a meal, there are times of activity and inactivity. We actively chop and prep, mix and fold, and gather ingredients and tools for the work ahead. We study the recipe and make a plan. 

All this is done before the actual cooking, which involves inactivity. Stiring,	sauteing, boiling, roasting, baking, grilling, resting, and raising are turms for the many forms of inactivity. 

Being intentional in the act of inactivity has the potential to nudge flavors and aromas into existence. Attention to inactivity and letting what happens unfold during cooking is a metaphor for life.
