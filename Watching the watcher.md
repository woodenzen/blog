Switching between the embodied stream of consciousness and the felt sense of being the universe perceiving itself helps notice how the word “I” moves between the observer, the body, and the larger field of the universe.

"Watch the watching", so the ordinary "I" loosens into a process rather than a fixed owner.

Merely a whirl in the universe's field of consciousness.

How does the universe look when “I” is treated as a verb (“I-ing”) rather than a noun?
- Language habits freeze verbs into things, making processes appear as entities.
- Re-verbalizing can melt the freeze, letting experience feel spacious and participatory.
