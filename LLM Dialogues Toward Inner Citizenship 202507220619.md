description: Using an LLM as a Socratic partner and a Stoic mirror lets you probe assumptions, sort what’s in your control, and loosen the grip of “I,” yielding steadier navigation through modern overload.

By combining Socratic self-examination, Stoic value-clarity, and AI-assisted perspective shifting, we can see that modern complexity is best met with disciplined curiosity and a flexible sense of self.

Using an LLM as a Socratic partner to probe assumptions, sort what’s in your control, and loosen the grip of “I,” yields steadier navigation through modern overload. In a prompt-response loop pose a worry to the model; have it ask clarifying “What do you mean?” and “How do you know?” questions until hidden premises surface.

Ask follow-up questions and text my thinking. Create a back-and-forth dialogue that explores the themes of the topic in question, whether it is a simple Q&A, a potentially deep philosophical conversation, or the outline of an article. 

A technique for exploring the positionality of "I" as exposed by Alan Watts and William James.
