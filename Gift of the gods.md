“Convince yourself that everything is the gift of the gods,” was how Marcus Aurelius put it, “that things are good and always will be.”

This is a Stoic idea that deepens the practice of gratitude. It's not about what is good, but about what is. Being grateful for all the problems and challenges is part of life, and sometimes it's the only way to get to the other side. My unending series of problems and challenges is what shapes my character. I can let them shape me as a crochety old man, or I can let them shape me as a better person.

I can decide to grab onto anger or appreciation, fear or fellowship. I can pick up the handle of resentment or gratitude. I can look at the obstacle or get a little closer and see the opportunity. 

Look at the life I've been gifted, not at where I've been deprived.
